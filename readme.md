# User Centric Knowledge Engineering and Data Visualization

## Problem:
## Solution:
## Exploring and Working with the Dashboard:

## Development:
- The project includes two portions, backend and frontend that are developed using ReactJS and Flask.

## Running on your local machine:
Tools and Frameworks used for developing this system:
1) [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) framework (for backend operations and handling requests)
2) [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) framework (for frontend user interface to interact with the system)
3) [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for deployment)
4) [Plotly](https://plotly.com/)  (for visualizations)

For running the system on the local machine, clone the repository and make sure that [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [python](https://www.python.org/) are installed. Another way is to have [docker]() installed, since its much easier way to get the system up and running. Once the repository is cloned. Run ```npm install``` command in the ```frontend``` directory and create virtual environment in ```backend``` directory, followed by ```pip install requiremets.txt```. This will install dependencies for both frontend and backend of the system. The final step includes running node and flask servers with commands ```npm start``` and ```flask run``` in respective directories.
